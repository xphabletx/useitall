Begin by preheating your oven at 200 degrees C for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, thoroughly wash the peppers and pat them completely dry. Then, slice the tops off to create a cavity in the peppers. Using a spoon,  scoop out the seeds.

Coat the peppers generously, on the outside with olive oil and line them on the baking tray, standing upright, with the open tops facing upwards. Place them in the oven, reduce the temperature to 180 degrees C and let them roast for 15 minutes, until they are partially roasted, but not cooked fully.

The latent heat of the rice will cause the cheddar to melt a little. This is essential.When the peppers have roasted partially, remove them from the oven and allow them to cool. Allow the oven to continue to pre heat, so you can put the peppers back inside once you have stuffed them.Using a tablespoon, fill the peppers with the rice mixture, taking care to press it in and fill the cavity tightly. You may garnish the tops with coriander and grated cheddar cheese too.

The dough portions will depend on how large your skillet is and how thick you want the pizza to be.Preheat a skillet, if you have a cast iron skillet even better. A regular heavy skillet will also work for the pizza. Grease the skillet and allow it to preheat while we roll out the pizza.Dust the pizza dough portions in flour and roll it out to fit the size of the skillet or frying pan.Then press the dough into the pan and cook over a medium heat for 8-10 mins or until the base is golden and you notice the top is rising and puffing up. We will be cooking the pizza on both sides like a bread. So flip over and cook for a few minutes on the opposite side as well.Once the pizza base has browned edges and has been cooked through, remove from the skillet. Proceed the same way with the remaining dough. The process of making this pizza will be more like a Naan. Keep the pizza bases aside. The next step is to assemble the Roasted Carrots Pizza with Pomegranate Sauce & Greek YogurtPlace the cooked pizza bases on a platter, smear the Greek Yogurt over the cooked pizza base, scatter the Harissa Roasted Carrots on the top and drizzle the Pomegranate Sauce over the Pizza.

Homemade Pita Bread Recipe - Quick and Simple Recipe,"Pitta or Pita Bread is a round pocket bread that is predominant in the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern Cuisines. Traditionally called as khubz (ordinary bread) it is similar to the Indian flat puffed flatbread (Phulkas ) which is also a bread of the common man. It can be made in various shapes and sizes, although if you are going to use it as a pocket for filling then the circular shape is preferred.  ",Mediterranean,Dinner,Vegetarian,"All Purpose Flour (Maida), Active dry yeast, Salt, Sugar, Water, Extra Virgin Olive Oil","3 cups All Purpose Flour (Maida)  2 teaspoons Active dry yeast  1/2 teaspoon Salt  1-1/2 teaspoons Sugar  1-1/4 cups Water , luke warm  2 tablespoons Extra Virgin Olive Oil",300,30,"To begin making the Homemade Pita Bread recipe, first prepare all the ingredients and keep them ready. Read the entire recipe before you begin, so you know the steps that follow.If you are using active dry yeast (look like small round balls) - follow the instructions given in the packet. Fast action yeast  looks more like fine semolina and you can use this too to make the pita bread.Note on Yeast:  If you have baker's instant yeast which resembles poppy seeds/fine semolina you don’t have to proof it, it can be added to the flour directly.If you have non-bakers yeast - which is active dry yeast where the size resembles tiny balls, then it needs to be proofed. Below is how you will proof your yeast. Proofing Yeast for the active dry yeast (which resembles small balls)In a large bowl, add the 2 teaspoons active dry yeast, 1/4 cup warm water, 1 teaspoon sugar. Give the yeast, water and sugar a little stir. The water should be warm enough to really get the yeast active. Let the mixture stand for 5-10 minutes.This allows the yeast enough time to gobble up all that sugar and produce plenty of carbon dioxide. Once it’s nice and bubbly, it’s ready to be incorporated into your mixture. If it does not bubble up, then the yeast is old and cannot be activated and cannot be used. In a large bowl combine the flour, salt and sugar and gradually add in the yeast and knead the dough until smooth and elastic, adding little flour if it tends to get sticky.Once all of the ingredients form a ball; add the olive oil and place the ball on a work surface and knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes. Repeated kneading combines all the ingredients well and will help the bread rise well in the oven.Once you have finished kneading and gained enough arm muscle; place the dough in a large bowl coated with olive oil and cover it with cling wrap/plastic wrap and allow it to rise for about 2 hours. After two hours you will notice that the dough has doubled. At this point punch the dough down and kneaded gently.Divide the dough into 10 portions and roll each portion into a ball. Place the balls on a baking sheet and cover them with a damp cloth and let them sit for another 30 minutes. While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 250 C. The oven should be preheated for at least half an hour before you can bake the pitas in them. Now it should be time to work your dough into flat bread.Take one ball, dust it with a little flour and dust the work surface as well. Using a rolling pin, roll the pita into an oval or a circle. Make sure the pitas are thin; about 1/8th inch or 1/4 inch thick. Continue the same with the remaining dough balls.Place the rolled portion of pita bread on dusted baking sheets and place it inside the oven. Bake the pita dough until they puff - you will see them rising forming bubbles, to slowly puffing and fully puffing up.The whole process takes a maximum or 3-5 minutes and not more than 5 minutes. If the pita bread does not rise in 5 minutes, then take them out. The Pita Bread will still be cooked, but just wont have pockets and will still taste just as good.Serve the delicious Homemade Pita Bread along with Tabbouleh,  Falafel and Hummus",https://www.archanaskitchen.com/images/archanaskitchen/World_Breads/Home_Made_Pita_Bread_Recipe-1.jpg

It is important to have a smooth surface and the ideal is granite counter top. Clean the counter top thoroughly as you will be spreading the cooked gram flour mixture. If you don't have a granite counter top, then you can use a flat plate or a smooth cookie sheet big enough to spread the mixture. If you do it on plates, or cookie sheets, you will probably have to spread the mixture in multiple rounds. The number of these plates you need will depend on how thin you spread the mixture. My estimate is about 3-4 plates of 12 inch diameter. Also if you use plates or cookie sheets, spread them on the back side.Transfer the khandvi batter into a non-stick pan and heat on low to medium heat, stirring constantly to prevent lump formation. Continue stirring on low heat, till the mixture thickens for 15 minutes.The mixture will begin to attain a shine. Once you notice the Khandvi batter has a shine to it and has thickened, turn off the heat. Keep the mixture covered, so it remains hot while you proceed to the steps below, as it will not spread when it cools down.Spread the hot mixture on the prepared surface as thinly as possible, with a flat spatula. When you have finished spreading the batter, allow it to cool a little and settle down about three minutes and not less. Repeat this process and continue to spread the entire mixture, before it cools down.After about 10 minutes have passed begin rolling the mixture into a log starting from the top. Once the rolls have been made, cut the rolls into one inch size logs. Place the cut rolls on a serving platter.Heat oil in a pan for seasoning; add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, sesame seeds, curry leaves allow them to crackle.Sprinkle the seasoning over the rolls and garnish with coriander leaves and coconut. This can be made one day ahead and kept in the refrigerator and warmed up in the microwave before serving.Serve Spinach Khandvi as a side dish along with Gujarati Dal, Aloo Bhindi and Hot Phulkas for your weekday lunch.",https://www.archanaskitchen.com/images/archanaskitchen/Indian_Appetizers/Spinach_Khandvi_Recipe_Gujarati_Farsan_Appetiser_Snack-6.jpg
